# AI Recommendation System Deployment
This code provides an example of building and deploying an AI recommendation system using collaborative filtering on a cloud platform. The code demonstrates the steps involved in training a recommendation model, saving it to a file, uploading it to AWS S3, and deploying it as a RESTful API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

# Data
The code assumes the availability of a CSV file named ratings.csv containing the user-item rating data. The data should have three columns: user_id, item_id, and rating. The rating column should represent the user's rating for the corresponding item.

# Model Training
The code uses the surprise library to preprocess and train the collaborative filtering model. It loads the rating data, creates a Dataset object, and trains a collaborative filtering model using the KNNWithMeans algorithm.

# Model Deployment
After training the model, it is saved to a file using the save() method. The file is then uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. The code proceeds to deploy the model as a RESTful API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It creates a Lambda function, an API Gateway REST API, and configures the integration between them.

# Usage
Prepare the user-item rating data in a CSV file named ratings.csv with columns user_id, item_id, and rating.

Set up your AWS credentials and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create and deploy Lambda functions and API Gateway.

Install the required dependencies, including pandas, numpy, boto3, and surprise.

Adjust any desired parameters, such as the number of neighbors (k) for the collaborative filtering model.

Run the code.

The model will be trained, saved, uploaded to AWS S3, and deployed as a RESTful API.

The API Gateway endpoint URL will be displayed, which can be used to make recommendations.
